# CaptureScreenshot
This Visual C++ code captures the screen and saves it as a JPEG file using the Windows API and GDI+. The code first gets the desktop device context and creates a device context to use itself. Then it creates a bitmap with the same size as the screen and selects it into the device context. It then copies from the desktop device context to the bitmap device context using BitBlt function. After that, it creates a CImage object and attaches it to the HBITMAP object. Finally, it saves the image as a JPEG file and deletes the bitmap used to capture frames. The software saves the JPEG to the Windows temp folder and returns a path so that it can be used for further processing.
